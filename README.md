# Sablier V1 [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/sablier-labs/v1-protocol.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/sablier-labs/v1-protocol) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sablier-labs/v1-protocol/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/sablier-labs/v1-protocol?branch=develop) [![Styled with Prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://prettier.io) [![Commitizen Friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) [![License: LGPL3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL%20v3-008033.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0)

This is the source code of the Sablier V1 token streaming protocol, which is a legacy release. The most recent release is V2 and can be found [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core). For more details about how Sablier works, check out our docs at [docs.sablier.com](https://docs.sablier.com)/.

This repo is structured as a monorepo:

| Package                                                   | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@sablier/dev-utils`](/packages/dev-utils)               | Dev utils to be shared across Sablier projects and packages       |
| [`@sablier/protocol`](/packages/protocol)                 | The core token streaming protocol                                 |
| [`@sablier/shared-contracts`](/packages/shared-contracts) | Smart contracts to be shared across Sablier projects and packages |

## Usage :hammer_and_pick:

To compile the smart contracts, bootstrap the monorepo and open the package you'd like to work on. For example, here are the instructions for `@sablier/protocol`:

```bash
$ yarn run bootstrap
$ cd packages/protocol
$ truffle compile --all
$ truffle migrate --reset --network development
```

Alternatively, if you simply want to use the UI, head to [v1-pay.sablier.com](https://v1-pay.sablier.com) to create streams and
[v1-app.sablier.com](https://v1-app.sablier.com) to withdraw from streams. You'll need an Ethereum wallet and some ERC20 tokens.
